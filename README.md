# Linux-Themed-Terminal
<br>
This is a simple but yet advacned terminal, written in python with default modules. This was tested on linux, but a few checks are in place for those commands that do not work on other OSes such as windows, etc. Not all checks are in place yet as this is still a WIP project.

Modules used:
- Socket (for hostname)
- Getpass (Used for getting the username)
- OS (Used for chaging and getting directory files)
- Subprocess (For checks)
- Platform (For displaying the current OS)
- Time (Making some text readable)
- Psutil (For getting current stats like CPU, RAM, etc.)
